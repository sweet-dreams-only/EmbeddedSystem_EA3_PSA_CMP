						<L-2 L="FOR-ALL">Float corresponds to the IEEE single-precision 32-bit floating point type
[IEEE 754-1985]. The basic value space of float consists of the values 
m × 2^e, where m is an integer whose absolute value is less than 2^24, 
and e is an integer between -149 and 104, inclusive. In addition to the basic
value space described above, the value space of Float also contains the 
following special values: positive and negative zero, positive and negative 
infinity and not-a-number. The order-relation on Float is: 
x &lt; y if y - x is positive. Positive zero is greater than negative zero.
Not-a-number equals itself and is greater than all float values including positive infinity. 

Float values have a lexical representation consisting of a mantissa followed, 
optionally, by the character "E" or "e", followed by an exponent. The exponent
must be an integer. The mantissa must be a decimal number. The representations
for exponent and mantissa must follow the lexical rules for integer and decimal.
If the "E" or "e" and the following exponent are omitted, an exponent value 
of 0 is assumed. 

The special values positive and negative zero, positive and negative infinity
and not-a-number have lexical representations 0, -0, INF, -INF and NaN, 
respectively. 

For example, -1E4, 1267.43233E12, 12.78e-2, 12 and INF are all legal literals
for Float.</L-2>
